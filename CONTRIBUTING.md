# CONTRIBUTING

Thank you for considering contributing to our project and please, read all this document. Ty ;)

Before start coding, please let's discuss it on the issues. This step can save precious time. 

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

All the coding needs to be added through Pull requests. 

1. Create an Issue before start coding and discuss about it.
2. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
3. Open a Pull Request at any point during the development process. Even if you only want to share something or asking for advices
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request.
